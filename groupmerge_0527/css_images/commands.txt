# First install glue
# on mac w/ homebrew:

$ brew install jpeg
$ pip install glue

# Then put the images you want to stitch together into a folder. In the following example, "athabasca" is the name of the folder containing the images. I don't know what on earth sprites means, but I copied it directly it seems to have worked. It creates a folder called "sprites", which contains a couple of files, including the stitched image and a css file that's automatically generated.

$ glue athabasca sprites --ordering=filename

# Use the python script css2tab, convert the pertinent info from the css file into a csv file

$ python css2tab.py sprites/athabasca
